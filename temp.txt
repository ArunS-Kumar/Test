I started my career in 2013 as a junior programmer in Codeigniter framework. From then to now, I got opportunities to work on different frameworks like laravel 5.6 , symfony 3, zend and phalcon. I use mysql and postGresSQl for database. I use git and docker on a daily basis.

One of my project is single sign on (SSO) system with user management, which is giving me lots of challenges and the chance to read tons of documents. I always eager to take new challenges and difficult task, because it will give me opportunities to learn new things. 

Apart from company project, i have some interest to develop a chrome extension. I developed 4 of them. Now working for these updates.







In my point of view following the code standard, unit and integration tests are important. new technologies and versions are emerging everyday, so we have to update ourselves.
